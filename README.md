### Step 4: Edit (or remove) Privacy Policy and Changelog
Your site automatically includes pages for a Privacy Policy and a Changelog. Change the content of these pages by editing the `privacypolicy.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` files in the `_pages` directory.

In each of the markdown files, you can set the `include_in_header:` value to either `true` or `false`. This determines if the page is included in the top navigation.
By default, only the Changelog is included in the top navigation. The title of the navigation item can also be edited, by editing the `title:` in each markdown file.

If you need to, you can create additional markdown based pages just by creating an `.md` file like the `privacypolicy.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` files in the `_pages` directory.

**Please note:** The Privacy Policy and Changelog provided are written using dummy text, so please adapt each of them for your own app.
You can also choose not to include these pages, by simple deleting the `privacypolicy.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` files.
